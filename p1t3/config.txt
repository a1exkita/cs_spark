The input file is "enwiki_small.xml" which is located at HDFS.
We used a standard cluster with 1 master & 2 workers with 5GB memory for driver and 5GB memory for executor.
In case you run the .py file in cluster, you are suppsed to put the .jar file in the job configuration.
By running this p1t3.ipynb file, you can generate a csv folder in HDFS.
Note: the p1t3.ipynb file generates a CSV file with an automatically assigned name under the foler named as "q8".
Our CSV file is manually renamed to p1t3.csv afterwards.
