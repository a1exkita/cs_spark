The input file is "enwiki_small.xml" which is located at HDFS.
Also, we locally downloaded the .jar file in the instruction.
We used a single node cluster with 1GB memory for driver and 5GB memory for executor for Part 1 Task2.
By running this p1t2.ipynb file, you can generate a csv folder in HDFS. 

Note: the p1t2.ipynb file generates a CSV file with an automatically assigned name under the foler named as "q2-small".
Our CSV file is manually renamed to p1t2.csv afterwards.
